/// **Data Pagination Contract Interface**
/// 
/// Defines the contract for items that can be used in paginated data structures.
/// This abstract class serves as a foundation for implementing pagination
/// functionality across different data types in the Notifi application.
/// 
/// **Domain Concepts:**
/// - **Pagination**: Dividing large datasets into smaller, manageable pages
/// - **Page Identification**: Each item must be identifiable for pagination logic
/// - **Data Abstraction**: Provides a common interface for different data types
/// - **Performance Optimization**: Enables efficient data loading and memory management
/// 
/// **Design Principles:**
/// - **Contract-First**: Defines the minimum requirements for paginated items
/// - **Type Safety**: Ensures all paginated items have required properties
/// - **Extensibility**: Can be implemented by any data type that needs pagination
/// - **Consistency**: Provides uniform pagination behavior across the application
/// 
/// **Business Rules:**
/// - Every paginated item must have a unique page identifier
/// - Page IDs should be consistent and predictable for navigation
/// - Implementation classes must provide meaningful page identification
/// - Page IDs should support efficient sorting and filtering operations
/// 
/// **Common Implementations:**
/// - List items that need to be paginated for performance
/// - Search results that are returned in pages
/// - Data entities that are loaded incrementally
/// - Any content that benefits from pagination to improve user experience
/// 
/// **Usage Examples:**
/// ```dart
/// // Example implementation for a news article
/// class NewsArticle implements PagingDataItem {
///   final int id;
///   final String title;
///   final String content;
///   
///   NewsArticle({required this.id, required this.title, required this.content});
///   
///   @override
///   int get pageId => id; // Use article ID as page identifier
/// }
/// 
/// // Example implementation for a user profile
/// class UserProfile implements PagingDataItem {
///   final int userId;
///   final String name;
///   final String email;
///   
///   UserProfile({required this.userId, required this.name, required this.email});
///   
///   @override
///   int get pageId => userId; // Use user ID as page identifier
/// }
/// ```
abstract class PagingDataItem {
  /// **Page Identifier Property**
  /// 
  /// Unique identifier used for pagination logic and navigation.
  /// This property is essential for implementing efficient pagination
  /// algorithms and maintaining consistent data ordering.
  /// 
  /// **Requirements:**
  /// - Must be unique within the paginated dataset
  /// - Should be stable and not change frequently
  /// - Should support efficient comparison operations
  /// - Should be meaningful for sorting and filtering
  /// 
  /// **Implementation Guidelines:**
  /// - Use the primary key or unique identifier of the data entity
  /// - Ensure the ID is available when the item is created
  /// - Consider using sequential IDs for natural ordering
  /// - Avoid using computed or volatile values
  /// 
  /// **Business Rules:**
  /// - Two items with the same pageId should be considered duplicates
  /// - Page IDs should be consistent across application restarts
  /// - The ID should be suitable for use in pagination algorithms
  /// - Should support efficient database queries and API calls
  /// 
  /// **Usage in Pagination:**
  /// - Used to determine page boundaries and navigation
  /// - Enables efficient "load more" functionality
  /// - Supports cursor-based pagination strategies
  /// - Allows for consistent data ordering across sessions
  /// 
  /// **Returns:**
  /// An integer identifier that uniquely represents this item
  /// within its paginated dataset.
  int get pageId;
